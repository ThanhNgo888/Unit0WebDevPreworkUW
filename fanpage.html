  <h2>Bio</h2>
  <p>The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960.
     With a line-up comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison 
     and Ringo Starr, they are regarded as the most influential band of all time.
     [1] The group were integral to the evolution of pop music into an art form 
     and to the development of the counterculture of the 1960s.[2] Their sound, 
     rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, incorporated elements of
     classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways. They also pioneered 
     recording techniques and explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian 
     music to psychedelia and hard rock. As they continued to draw influences from a
     variety of cultural sources, their musical and lyrical sophistication grew,
     and they came to be seen as embodying the era's socio-cultural movements.</p>
